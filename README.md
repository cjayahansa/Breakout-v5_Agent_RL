# 🕹️ Breakout-v5 Reinforcement Learning Agent

This project implements a **Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent** trained to play the **Breakout-v5** game environment using **Gymnasium** (the successor to OpenAI Gym).  
The goal is for the agent to learn how to control the paddle and maximize the score by breaking as many bricks as possible.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

**Breakout-v5** is a classic Atari environment where the player controls a paddle to bounce a ball upward to destroy bricks.  
This project uses deep reinforcement learning techniques such as **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)** or **Double DQN** to train an AI model that learns through trial and error.

The training process involves:
- Observing the game state (pixels or processed frames)
- Choosing an action (move left, right, or stay)
- Receiving a reward (for breaking bricks)
- Updating the neural network to improve decision-making
